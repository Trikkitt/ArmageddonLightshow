All models can be printed without supports except for the "CPU Mounting" model, which requires supports.  The "Pin" model should be printed with a decent brim.

For the best finish I've printed mine onto a textured bed.  The top and bottom layers of the front are printed with a Hilbert curve to avoid the appearance of long lines that can be fairly visible in some prints with monotonic top and bottom layers.  I also printed the bottom layer with one wall only to get the most detail from the phasers.  Infill is Gyroid to give the edge a nice look when illuminated.  You may want to play around with the alignment of the phasers when setting up the print.  You may wish to rotate the phasers to a position that you favour, be aware that the design makes the hanging point be exactly midway between two the retaining legs of the front.

Everything is printed in black except for the front which is printed in transparent filament along with black (or your colour of choice) for the phasers and Armageddon logo.

You need one of each item except for the clips, of which you will need 6, although I recommend printing a few spares, and the pins of which you will need 3 but you may well want to print a few spares.

I do not recommend using PLA for this, the LEDs can get quite warm.  So probably aim for a higher temperature filament.  I've used PETG just fine, which also gives everything a little flexibility.

This was created in TinkerCad and you can access the design there in https://www.tinkercad.com/things/3HTQpiZR87c-armageddon-disc-final

Assembly steps are as follows:
1 - Get your parts 3D printed and get your electronics prepared as per the electronics instructions and photos - except do not solder the LED rings to the main electronics as they must pass through a hole in one of the plastic parts.
2 - Place the LED rings onto the back plate, the raised ridges of the back plate should pop through the gaps between the rings.  Ensure the wires go through the large long opening at the back.
3 - Fully assemble the CPU holder part electronics, including attaching the LED rings wires onto the electronics in the CPU holder.
4 - Ensure the wires are as neatly retained as possible to avoid snagging.  
5 - Place the CPU retainer over the USB C port so that it holds the RaspberryPi Pico in place
6 - Place the CPU holder against the back plate so that the raised parts fit inside the grooves, then slide slowly up making sure no wires are snagged.  You will know when it has fully reached its end position as the bottom two round holes in the black plate will match up with two round holes of the CPU holder.
7 - Place the back plate onto the clear front so that the legs pop through.  Be sure to orientate the front so that your desired phaser as at the centre top.
8 - Place the clips around each clear leg to hold the front onto the back plate.

Extra things: I recommend making sure all the plastics fit together before you put the electronics into it.  This just ensures your prints are good.  The same applies to the electronics, make sure you've tested it before you fully assemble.
