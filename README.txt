All models can be printed without supports except for the "CPU Mounting" model, which requires supports.  The "Pin" model should be printed with a decent brim.

For the best finish I've printed mine onto a textured bed.  The top and bottom layers of the front are printed with a Hilbert curve to avoid the appearance of long lines that can be fairly visible in some prints with monotonic top and bottom layers.  I also printed the bottom layer with one wall only to get the most detail from the phasers.  Infill is Gyroid to give the edge a nice look when illuminated.  You may want to play around with the alignment of the phasers when setting up the print.  You may wish to rotate the phasers to a position that you favour, be aware that the design makes the hanging point be exactly midway between two the retaining legs of the front.

You need one of each item except for the clips, of which you will need 6, although I recommend printing a few spares, and the pins of which you will need 3 but you may well want to print a few spares.

I do not recommend using PLA for this, the LEDs can get quite warm.  So probably aim for a higher temperature filament.  I've used PETG just fine, which also gives everything a little flexibility.
